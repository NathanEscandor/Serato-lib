=== What ===

The goal of this repo is to document the basic file formats of the Rane Serato
Scratch Live databases.

The libraries generated from this work should eventually allow for read/write
actions against the SSL db/crate files

== sslcrate.py ==

Working script that reads in and performs very basic parsing of the Serato
Scratch crate files.

Meant for debugging purposes only.

== TODO ==

- generate read / write classes for crate/db files
- s/mmap/construct/ libraries for cleaner parsing  of the binary structures
